### [BLAST üí£](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blast) ([BLAST-1.8.2.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blast/files/3543409)‚ü∂[BLAST-1.8.3.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blast/files/3684852))

#### [BLAST-1.8.3.jar](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/blast/files/3684852)

BLAST - Changelog:

:

BLAST 1.8.3 - 1.18.1

* Added a recipe to allow crafting stripminers with TNT

BLAST 1.8.2 - 1.18

* Updated to Minecraft 1.18

BLAST 1.8.1 - 1.17.1

* Made the bombard recipe cheaper, now requiring iron ingots instead of iron blocks
* Made the bombard upgrade to amethyst bombard more expensive, now requiring an amethyst block instead of a single amethyst shard
* Fixed normal bombs and dirt bombs having inverted names
* Added a Romanian translation thanks to WindRat
* Added a Russian translation thanks to V972

BLAST 1.8 - 1.17.1

* Added a new item class, the bombards! These new weapons allow you to launch bombs and trigger bombs further, at the cost of disabling their destructive nature. Each bombard type is unique and will transform your bombs into something different!
* Bombard: The normal bombard, throws bombs and trigger bombs but disables their block destruction. Crafted from 6 iron blocks on the side, with a cauldron, a piston and a lever in the middle respectively from top to bottom.
* Slime Bombard: Obtained by smithing a Bombard with a slime block, this bombard covers the launched bombs in slime that will result in no damage being dealt to the entities in the explosion radius of the bombs, while giving the explosion a stronger knockback. Great for elytra and chicken launching!
* Amethyst Bombard: Obtained by smithing a Bombard with an amethyst shard, this bombard will not cause any explosion damage, but will spurt out amethyst shards with cumulative damage.
* Frost Bombard: Obtained by smithing an Amethyst Bombard with blue ice, this bombard will act similar to the amethyst bombard but will instead shatter your bombs into icicles. These icicles deal significantly less damage than amethyst shards (a quarter of a heart compared to 2 for the amethyst shard) but will cumulatively apply freezing to the hit entities!
* Added Dirt Bombs. Crafted by surrounding a bomb or trigger bomb in dirt blocks, this bomb will help you fill holes with dirt or terraform your land!
* Added Pearl Bombs. Crafted like other bombs with an ender pearl as the material, this bomb will have a silk touch effects on blocks it destroys. It doesn't explode, but still respects the same logic. All living entities inside the bomb's radius will be randomly teleported.
* Explosions from Blast will now properly be attributed to the player or entity who threw the bomb, meaning entities affected by the explosion will retaliate, and death messages will no longer hide your true intentions, like that one time when you threw a trigger bomb at your friend voluntarily and justified it as a misclick.
* Fixed an issue that caused stripminers and colddiggers to crash game clients

BLAST 1.7.1 - 1.17.1

* Fixed an issue that caused trigger bombs to explode with the player right after throwing them while running or flying
* Fixed an issue that caused bomb explosions to not always affect entities with the knockback they should

BLAST 1.7 - 1.17.1

* Added confetti bombs, exists in fuse and trigger variants
* Explodes into a burst of confetti! Perfect for all your festive needs!
* Crafted shapelessly from 7 paper, 1 gunpowder and 1 string / dust (fuse / trigger)
* Added a fuse smoking particle effect to fuse bombs
* Updated to 1.17.1

BLAST 1.6.2 - 1.17

* Fixed an issue that would cause the dry ice particles to not display properly
* Updated to 1.17, thanks to Spiralhalo!

BLAST 1.6.1 - 21w14a

* Fixed an issue that caused naval mines to make freezing explosions
* Naval mines no longer suffer negative drag underwater
* Trigger bombs no longer require stone buttons in order to be crafted

BLAST 1.6 - 21w14a

* Added the Cold Digger, a cool stripminer upgrade allowing to quickly create tunnels by freezing the water around into ice, turning the lava into basalt and chill the air into dry ice!
* Added Dry Ice, identical to ice except it doesn't melt and doesn't create water. Can be obtained when using the Cold Digger and can be picked up with a Silk Touch pickaxe.

BLAST 1.5.2 - 1.16.5

* Tweaked the Stripminer recipe to be more in line with the other recipes of the mod

BLAST 1.5.1 - 1.16.5

* Diamond bombs no longer destroy undestroyable blocks like command blocks, barriers or end portal frames
* Fixed an issue that caused stripminers to disappear and drop a bomb when submerged in water

BLAST 1.5 - 1.16.4

* Added trigger bombs: bombs that explode on impact, available in iron, gold and diamond variants
* Added French translation (courtesy of Lykrast)
* Stripminers now have a random decreased fuse timer when triggered by an explosion
